The folders in this repository consist of Data_rep_MD which is a parallelised version of Molecular Dynamic simulation without periodic boundary conditions implemented. Periodic boundary conditions which is a serial version of the Molecular Dynamics simulation with Periodic Boundary conditions implemented. Serial which is a serial version of the Molecular dynamics simulation and para_MD which is our final parallelised molecular dynamic simulation code which contains periodic boundary conditions.

The code is easy to use all it requires is compiling and running and to edit the number of atoms and other parameters this must be done within the CPP file.
